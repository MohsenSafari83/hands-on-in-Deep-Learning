# Backpropagation and Gradient Descent: Deep Learning Fundamentals

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Backpropagation_and_GradientDescent.ipynb`) dedicated to explaining and exploring two fundamental and vital concepts in **Deep Learning** and **Neural Networks**: the **Gradient Descent Algorithm** and the **Backpropagation Algorithm**.

The goal of this notebook is to provide a comprehensive and practical resource for understanding how neural networks are optimized and trained effectively.

## Key Concepts Covered

In this notebook, the following concepts are explained step-by-step:

* **Gradient Descent Algorithm:**
    * Defining Gradient Descent as a powerful **optimization algorithm**.
    * Its primary purpose: finding the **minimum of the Cost (Loss) Function** using derivatives (gradients).
* **Backpropagation:**
    * The core training mechanism used in all modern neural networks.
    * Explaining how **error is calculated and propagated backward** to previous layers to update weights.
* **Advantages of Backpropagation:**
    * Ease of implementation and accessibility via deep learning libraries like **PyTorch** and **Keras**.
* **Limitations and Challenges:**
    * Discussing the impact of **Data Quality** and challenges related to **long Training Duration** and the **Matrix-Based Complexity** in large networks.
